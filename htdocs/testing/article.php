				Andrew L. Brown is a native of Chicago, and a third-generation United States Army Soldier, who has served as both a Non-Commissioned and a Commissioned Officer, achieving the rank of First Lieutenant.
<br/><br/>
Andrew earned a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Benedictine University. He graduated from De Paul University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Communications and was commissioned a second lieutenant following Reserve Officer Training Corps there. Andrew retired after 14.5 years of service in the United States Army where he completed a successful tour as a Medical Service Officer. Andrew’s military performance warranted numerous recommendations by Commanders for promotions and special assignments. His military decorations include: Army Achievement Medal (3 awards), Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal, National Defense Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Illinois Army National Guard Long and Honorable Service Medal, Parachute Badge, and numerous awards and certificates.
<br/><br/>
In 1998, at the highlight of his military career, Andrew was involved in a near-fatal auto accident as a pedestrian. The accident resulted in Andrew experiencing three days in a coma, seven major surgeries, and two years of rehabilitation to learn to walk and talk again. Andrew’s ability to galvanize his faith and intestinal fortitude helped propel his recovery. As a result of the severe economic impact of his extensive recovery period, Andrew recognized leadership is empowered by financial planning and stewardship, which are necessary to overcome life’s unexpected adversities.
In 1999, Andrew established “Decision To Destiny®”, an inspirational speaking and leadership development firm. To date, he has worked with more than 10,000 people in diverse markets ranging from education, corporate, and government industries, guiding his audiences to workable solutions to achieve their goals in Leadership, Personal Development and Strategy.

Much of his success centers on his ability to encourage audience members to understand the “TRI-E Attitude” (Educate, Evaluate, and Elevate®), and believe in their abilities to excel and achieve their goals and dreams. He is the author of “Overcome Adversity …Your Dreams Matter!!!”
<br/><br/>
Andrew looks forward to his Wall Street Warfighters experience as a means to apply his talents as an accomplished author, speaker, and trainer to the field of finance. He hopes to develop a better understanding of financial strategies to grow capital, leverage risk, and develop a winning portfolio track record.
