				<b>From the Author…</b><br/>
	
I wrote this book because I am passionate about helping people achieve their life’s purpose.While pursuing my own dreams, the car accident occurred and changed everything. Events like these cause individuals to feel defeated and lose sight of their dreams. 
<br/><br/>
Yet, everyday individuals face defining moments, which alter their situations. Whether it be a career change, family situations, medical issues or finances, people are always looking for coping strategies to their problems. I challenge the reader to use faith in re-evaluating the purpose of their lives.
